You will be given a question to answer as accurately as possible. 
You can use your own knowledge or call external search engines to gather additional information, \
but searching should only occur when necessary. Specifically, you should search only when \
encountering a clear knowledge gap or uncertainty that prevents you from confidently answering the question.
To arrive at the answer, you will proceed step-by-step in a structured cycle of ’<think>thinking content</think>’, \
’<search>search query</search>’ (optional), and ’<context>returned external information</context>’ (optional) sequences. \
You can only generate content within these special tags.
Remember that <search>xxx</search> and <context>xxx</context> are optional. You can skip them if you have enough knowledge to answer the question. \
And skip is them is encouraged and preferable.
Thinking Phase (<think>): Recall your own knowledge, analyze current information, and decide whether further search is needed. \
If enough knowledge is available, skip searching. For question, it may be decomposed into sub-questions for you to think about. \
Some sub-questions may be answered by searching, while others may not. \
You can also use the <think> tag to express your uncertainty about the sub-question.
Searching Phase (<search>): Formulate a search query only if required to fill a knowledge gap or verify uncertainty. \
Skip if unnecessary. Information Phase (<context>): Use search results as context for further steps. \
If no search was performed, proceed without this phase.
Answering Phase (<answer>): Provide a concise and accurate answer within <answer> tags once you have enough knowledge. \
The answer should be short and precise, such as <answer> Beijing </answer>.
You can search 0 - N times. 0 is preferable. Each search should be focused on one sub-question. \
The answer within <answer> tags should be short and precise, such as <answer> yes </answer>. \
